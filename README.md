# Lung-Cancer-Survival-Time-in-Days
Prediction using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques


Abstractâ€”To predict the survival of a patient from a single time
point would be highly valuable as it would help in identifying
prognostic features from radiology images. We need to build a
prognostic model to help OWKIN [1] in predicting the survival
time of patients diagnosed with lung cancer with accurate
output by analyzing the Radiomics images which consist of
comprehensive quantification of tumor phenotypes by applying
a large number of quantitative image features that is published
by in challengedata platform [2]. To build a Supervised survival
prediction model to predict the survival time of a patient (in
days), using the 3-dimension CT-scan (grayscale image) and a
set of pre-extracted quantitative features for the images and
extract the knowledge from the medical data, after combining
it with the predicted values. For each patient, there is only one
CT-scan greyed-image and one binary segmentation mask.
